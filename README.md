## IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
Access to this draft code is reserved for IMS Contributing Members who are active participants of the IMS Learning Analytics Task Force.  Dissemination of this code to outside parties is strictly prohibited. By accessing these materials you agree to abide by these rules. This code is in draft format and will change substantially. 

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites for development:  

* Ensure you have php5 and php5-json installed.  E.g. sudo apt-get install php5 php5-json
* Install Composer (for dependency management) - curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php 
* Install dependencies - php composer.phar install
* Run tests using the Makefile

### Installing and using the Library:

To install the library, clone the repository from github into your desired application directory.

git clone https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-php.git

Then, add the following to your PHP script:

```
require_once("/path/to/caliper-php/lib/Caliper.php");
```

Now, you're ready to initialize the Caliper module as follows:

```
$options = array();
$options["host"] = 'acme.caliperstore.com';
$options["sensor_id"] = 'com.acme.sensor1';
Caliper::init('com.acme.apikey', $options);
```

You only need to call init once when your php file is requested. All of your files will then have access to the same Caliper client.
